Notes: Changed the javascript so that the whole sequence is repeated each new level, not just the new button.
This makes it much easier to remember the sequence and progress in the game.
Also added instructions on how to play the game.

  Instructions: Each level, a sequence of buttons will flash and play a sound.
  The goal is to remember the sequence and push the buttons in the correct order. A new button is added 
  to the sequence every level. Getting the sequence wrong ends the current game.
